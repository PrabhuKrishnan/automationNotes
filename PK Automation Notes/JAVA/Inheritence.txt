Inheritence in java:

-Inheritence allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavour from other classes
-Inheritence, deriving the properties(members, methods,nested calsses) of the superclass
-With this we can resue the fields and methods of the existing class
-constructor are not members,so they are not inherited by subcalsses
-But the constructor of the superclass can be invoked  from the superclass
-with Inheritence we can acheive the Reuseability in java
