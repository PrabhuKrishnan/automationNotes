Arrays

--An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type
--The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed

you can declare arrays of other types:

byte[] anArrayOfBytes;
short[] anArrayOfShorts;
long[] anArrayOfLongs;
float[] anArrayOfFloats;
double[] anArrayOfDoubles;
boolean[] anArrayOfBooleans;
char[] anArrayOfChars;
String[] anArrayOfStrings;

You can also place the brackets after the array's name:

// this form is discouraged
float anArrayOfFloats[];
