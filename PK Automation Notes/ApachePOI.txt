Reading the Excel data:

-First get the total number of rows 
-And also get the total number of columns
-Then we need to use two for loops to iterate the rows and columns
-Then in the outer loop we need to iterate the rows 
-Then in the inner loop we need to iterate the columns(cells) from the selected row
-Then we need to check the type of data from the excel file
